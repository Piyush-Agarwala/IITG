Objective*  To ensure safe handling and use of *hydrochloric acid (HCl)* solutions of different concentrations during pH determination using *pH paper* and *universal indicator*.  ---  ### *2. Chemical Information*  * *Chemical name:* Hydrochloric acid (HCl) * *Nature:* Strong acid; corrosive * *Hazard classification:*    * Corrosive to skin, eyes, and mucous membranes   * Produces irritating and toxic fumes (HCl vapour)  ---  ### *3. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)*  ‚úÖ *Mandatory PPE:*  * Lab coat or apron (acid-resistant if available) * Safety goggles or face shield * Nitrile or rubber gloves * Closed shoes (no sandals) * Long pants and tied-back hair  ---  ### *4. Laboratory Safety Precautions*  * Work in a *well-ventilated area* or *fume hood* when handling concentrated acid. * *Never* pipette by mouth; use a pipette filler or bulb. * Always *add acid to water*, not water to acid ‚Äî prevents splashing or violent reaction. * Use *labeled containers* for each concentration to avoid mix-up. * Keep *neutralizing agents* (e.g., sodium bicarbonate or sodium carbonate) nearby. * Keep a *source of running water* or an *eye-wash station* accessible.  ---  ### *5. Handling Procedures*  1. *Preparation of dilute acids:*     * Carefully measure the required volume of stock HCl.    * Slowly pour the acid into water with gentle stirring.    * Allow solutions to cool before testing.  2. *Testing with indicators:*     * Use small quantities of solution (5‚Äì10 mL).    * Avoid touching pH paper or universal indicator with bare hands.    * Do not reuse contaminated indicator droppers or strips.  3. *Observation:*     * Observe color changes on white background for clarity.    * Dispose of used strips in a designated waste bin.  ---  ### *6. Spill and Accident Procedures*  * *Minor acid spill:*   Sprinkle sodium bicarbonate or carbonate powder to neutralize; wipe with plenty of water. * *Skin contact:*   Immediately flush with *copious running water* for at least *10‚Äì15 minutes*. * *Eye contact:*   Rinse eyes in *eye-wash station* for *15‚Äì20 minutes* and seek medical help. * *Inhalation:*   Move to fresh air immediately; seek medical attention if irritation persists. * *Ingestion:*   Do *not* induce vomiting; rinse mouth with water and call for medical help.  ---  ### *7. Waste Disposal*  * Collect all acid wastes in a labeled *‚ÄúAcid Waste‚Äù* container. * Neutralize before disposal if permitted by lab rules. * Rinse all glassware thoroughly with water before returning.  ---  ### *8. Emergency Equipment to Keep Nearby*  * First aid kit * Eye wash and safety shower * Sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO‚ÇÉ) for neutralization * Fire extinguisher (CO‚ÇÇ type) * Clean water supply  ---  ### *9. Good Laboratory Practices*  * Do not eat, drink, or use mobile phones in the laboratory. * Label all beakers and flasks clearly. * Keep workspace organized and dry. * Report all accidents or spills immediately to the instructor or lab supervisor. * Wash hands thoroughly after completing the experiment.  ---  ### *10. Disposal and Clean-up*  * Neutralize any residual acid before pouring into sink (if allowed by instructor). * Dispose of pH paper and indicator-stained samples in *non-recyclable chemical waste*. * Clean the bench with a wet cloth to remove traces of acid.  ---  ‚úÖ *Summary of Key Rules*  | DO‚Äôs                          | DON‚ÄôTs                              | | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | | Wear full PPE                 | Never mix acid with base directly   | | Add acid to water slowly      | Don‚Äôt pipette by mouth              | | Work in ventilated area       | Don‚Äôt touch acid with bare skin     | | Neutralize spills immediately | Don‚Äôt dispose acid directly in sink |  ---"
